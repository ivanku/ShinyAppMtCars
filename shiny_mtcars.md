Executive summary
========================================================
<small>
Whether automatic or manual transmission is better for MPG is a subject of heated debates.

We used data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine that comprises fuel consumption and 10
aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models) to offer our users
a possibility to visually and interactively explore the dependencies and make their own conclusions.
